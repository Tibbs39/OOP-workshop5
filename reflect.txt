This workshop I've learned to define lambda expressions,
prevent the copying, moving and assigning of an object
as well as throw and report exceptions. I've also learned
to use enum classes. This workshop has made me consider
the use cases of creating and throwing exceptions in larger
projects as well as made me try to think of scenarios as to 
why one might want to prevent the copying, moving, and assigning 
of an object.
